WORKING WITH CSVâ€™s in SQLite
============================

Working with CSV's in SQLite is simple :)

You're able to both import CSV files and export data as CSV files from SQLite.


##EXPORT DATA TO CSV FROM DATABASE


> sqlite> .mode csv

> sqlite> .output newFile.csv

> sqlite> SELECT * FROM myTable;

> sqlite> .exit


##IMPORT YOUR CSV INTO A TABLE

> $ sqlite3 new.db   <--- If you'd like your csv's in a new database remember to make it first

> sqlite> CREATE TABLE myTable() <--- Build your schema!

> sqlite> .mode csv

> sqlite> .import newFile.csv myTable


There are a few limitations you'll come up against working this way.
SQLite can't handle EVERYTHING but it's a great start!

You'll learn a ton about how to handle more complex data if you take
our Intro to Data Wrangling course.

If you are doing our OpenStreetMaps project, importing CSV's like this works just fine!
